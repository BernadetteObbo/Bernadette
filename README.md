Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Bernadette Obbo from Uganda. I have been living in Germany since December 2021. My educational and work background are in Accounting, however, I am quite curious about how things work from a technological perspective and Accounting never satisfied my curiousty regarding this. I find studying Computer Science a way to satisfy my curiosity while having fun and this is what motivates me to do this course.
