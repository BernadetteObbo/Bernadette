Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Bernadette Obbo from Uganda. I have been living in Germany since December 2021. My educational and work background are in Accounting, however, I am quite curious about how things work from a technology perspective and Accounting never satisfied my curiousty regarding this. I find Information Technology a way to satisfy my curiosity while having fun and this is what motivates me to do this course. 
In my accounting course Information Technology was one of the course units I studied. In addition, in order to do my accounting job, I had to know how to use a computer and MS Office to write reports using MS Word and MS Excel; make presentations using MS Powerpoint, communicate via email with colleagues using MS Outlook and collaborate with teammates on MS Teams.
