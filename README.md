Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Bernadette Obbo from Uganda. I have been living in Germany since December 2021. My educational and work background are in Accounting, however, I am quite curious about how things work from a technological perspective and Accounting never satisfied my curiousty regarding this. I find studying Computer Science a way to satisfy my curiosity while having fun and this is what motivates me to do this course. 
As part of my Accounting studies, Information Technology was one of the course units offered. The course unit covered the basics of computers, networking and MS Office. In addition, in order to do my accounting job, I had to use MS Office to write reports using MS Word and MS Excel; to make presentations using MS PowerPoint; to communicate via email with colleagues using MS Outlook and to collaborate with teammates using MS Teams. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a student at ReDi School.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a course on Introduction to Computer Science. I am also studying Deutsch.
